Buildozer is a tool for creating application packages easily.

The goal is to have one "buildozer.spec" file in your app directory, describing
your application requirements and settings such as title, icon, included modules
etc. Buildozer will use that spec to create a package for Android, iOS, Windows,
OSX and/or Linux.

Buildozer currently supports packaging for Android via the [python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/)
project, and for iOS via the kivy-ios project. iOS and OSX are still under work.

For Android, buildozer will automatically download and prepare the
build dependencies. For more information, see
[Android-SDK-NDK-Information](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Android-SDK-NDK-Information).
Note that only Python 3 is supported.

Note that this tool has nothing to do with the eponymous online build service
[buildozer.io](https://buildozer.io).

## Installing Buildozer with target Python 3 (default):

- Install buildozer:

      # via pip (latest stable, recommended)
      # if you use a virtualenv, don't use the `--user` option
      pip install --user buildozer

      # latest dev version
      # if you use a virtualenv, don't use the `--user` option
      pip install --user https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/archive/master.zip

      # git clone, for working on buildozer
      git clone https://github.com/kivy/buildozer
      cd buildozer
      python setup.py build
      pip install -e .

- Check buildozer is in your path

      `which buildozer`
      # if there is no result, and you installed with --user, add this line at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file.
      export PATH=~/.local/bin/:$PATH
      # and then run
      . ~/.bashrc

- Go into your application directory and run:

      buildozer init
      # edit the buildozer.spec, then
      buildozer android debug deploy run


## Buildozer Docker image

A Dockerfile is available to use buildozer through a Docker environment.

- Build with:

      docker build --tag=buildozer .

- Run with:

      docker run --volume "$(pwd)":/home/user/hostcwd buildozer --version


## Buildozer GitHub action

Use [ArtemSBulgakov/buildozer-action@v1](https://github.com/ArtemSBulgakov/buildozer-action)
to build your packages automatically on push or pull request.
See [full workflow example](https://github.com/ArtemSBulgakov/buildozer-action#full-workflow).

## `buildozer.spec`

See [buildozer/default.spec](https://raw.github.com/kivy/buildozer/master/buildozer/default.spec) for an up-to-date spec file.


## Default config

You can override the value of *any* `buildozer.spec` config token by
setting an appropriate environment variable. These are all of the
form ``$SECTION_TOKEN``, where SECTION is the config file section and
TOKEN is the config token to override. Dots are replaced by
underscores.

For example, here are some config tokens from the [app] section of the
config, along with the environment variables that would override them.

- ``title`` -> ``$APP_TITLE``
- ``package.name`` -> ``$APP_PACKAGE_NAME``
- ``p4a.source_dir`` -> ``$APP_P4A_SOURCE_DIR``
