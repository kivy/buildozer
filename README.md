# Buildozer

Buildozer is a development tool for turning  [Python](https://www.python.org/)
applications into binary packages ready for installation on any of a number of
platforms, including mobile devices.

The app developer provides a single "buildozer.spec" file, which describes the
application's requirements and settings, such as title and icons. Buildozer can
then create installable packages for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and/or Linux.

Buildozer is managed by the [Kivy Team](https://kivy.org/about.html). It relies
on its sibling projects: 
[python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/) and 
[Kivy for iOS](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/). It has features to make
building apps using the [Kivy framework](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) easier,
but it can be used independently - even with other GUI frameworks.

For Android, buildozer will automatically download and prepare the
build dependencies. For more information, see
[Android SDK NDK Information](https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Android-SDK-NDK-Information).

> [!NOTE]
> This tool is unrelated to the online build service,
> `buildozer.io`.

## Installation

Buildozer 

## Installing Buildozer with target Python 3 (default):

Buildozer incorporates a number of technologies, and has a complicated
dependencies, including platform dependencies outside of Python.

This means installation is more than a simple `pip install`; many of our support
requests are related to missing dependencies. 

So, it is important to follow the instructions carefully.

Please see the 
[Installation documentation](https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
specific to this version.

## Buildozer Docker image

A Dockerfile is available to use buildozer through a Docker environment.

- Build with:

```bash
docker build --tag=buildozer .
```

- Run with:

```bash
docker run --volume "$(pwd)":/home/user/hostcwd buildozer --version
```

> [!WARNING]  
> [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) contains an obsolete Docker image for
> Buildozer. It is deprecated. Build your own.

### Example Build with Caching
- Build and keep downloaded SDK and NDK in `~/.buildozer` directory: 

```bash
docker run -v $HOME/.buildozer:/home/user/.buildozer -v $(pwd):/home/user/hostcwd kivy/buildozer android debug
```

## Examples of Buildozer commands

buildozer android clean
buildozer android update
buildozer android deploy
buildozer android debug
buildozer android release

# or all in one (compile in debug, deploy on device)
buildozer android debug deploy

# set the default command if nothing set
buildozer setdefault android debug deploy run
```

## `buildozer.spec`

Run `buildozer init` to have a new `buildozer.spec` file copied into the current
working directory. Edit it before running your first build.

See [buildozer/default.spec](https://raw.github.com/kivy/buildozer/master/buildozer/default.spec) for the template.

## Default config

You can override the value of any `buildozer.spec` config token by
setting an appropriate environment variable. These are all of the
form `$SECTION_TOKEN`, where SECTION is the config file section and
TOKEN is the config token to override. Dots are replaced by
underscores.

For example, here are some config tokens from the [app] section of the
config, along with the environment variables that would override them.

- `title` -> `$APP_TITLE`
- `package.name` -> `$APP_PACKAGE_NAME`
- `p4a.source_dir` -> `$APP_P4A_SOURCE_DIR`
