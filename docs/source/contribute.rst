Contribution Guidelines
=======================

Buildozer is part of the `Kivy <https://kivy.org>`_ ecosystem - a large group of
products used by many thousands of developers for free, but it
is built entirely by the contributions of volunteers. We welcome (and rely on)
users who want to give back to the community by contributing to the project.

Contributions can come in many forms. See the latest
`Contribution Guidelines <https://github.com/kivy/buildozer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
for general guidelines of how you can help us.
