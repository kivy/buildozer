Specifications
==============

This document explains in detail all the configuration tokens you can use in
`buildozer.spec`.

Section [app]
-------------

- `title`: String, title of your application.
  
  It might be possible that some characters are not working depending on the
  targeted platform. It's best to try and see if everything works as expected.
  Try to avoid too long titles, as they will also not fit in the title
  displayed under the icon.

- `package.name`: String, package name.

  The Package name is one word with only ASCII characters and/or numbers. It
  should not contain any special characters. For example, if your application
  is named `Flat Jewels`, the package name can be `flatjewels`.

- `package.domain`: String, package domain.

  Package domain is a string that references the company or individual that
  did the app. Both domain+name will become your application identifier for
  Android and iOS, choose it carefully. As an example, when the Kivy`s team
  is publishing an application, the domain starts with `org.kivy`.

- `source.dir`: String, location of your application sources.

  The location must be a directory that contains a `main.py` file. It defaults
  to the directory where `buildozer.spec` is.

- `source.include_exts`: List, file extensions to include.

  By default, not all files in your `source.dir` are included, but only some
  of them (`py,png,jpg,kv,atlas`), depending on the extension. Feel free to
  add your own extensions, or use an empty value if you want to include
  everything.

- `source.exclude_exts`: List, file extensions to exclude.

  In contrary to `source.include_exts`, you could include all the files you
  want except the ones that end with an extension listed in this token. If
  empty, no files will be excluded based on their extensions.

- `source.exclude_dirs`: List, directories to exclude.

  Same as `source.exclude_exts`, but for directories. You can exclude your
  `tests` and `bin` directory with::

    source.exclude_dirs = tests, bin

- `source.exclude_patterns`: List, files to exclude if they match a pattern.

  If you have a more complex application layout, you might need a pattern to
  exclude files. It also works if you don't have a pattern. For example::

    source.exclude_patterns = license,images/originals/*

- `version.regex`: Regex, Regular expression to capture the version in
  `version.filename`.

  The default capture method of your application version is by grepping a line
  like this::

    __version__ = "1.0"

  The `1.0` will be used as a version.

- `version.filename`: String, defaults to the main.py.

  File to use for capturing the version with `version.regex`.

- `version`: String, manual application version.

  If you don't want to capture the version, comment out both `version.regex`
  and `version.filename`, then put the version you want directly in the
  `version` token::

    # version.regex =
    # version.filename = 
    version = 1.0

- `requirements`: List, Python modules or extensions that your application
  requires.

  The requirements can be either a name of a recipe in the Python-for-android
  project, or a pure-Python package. For example, if your application requires
  Kivy and requests, you need to write::

    requirements = kivy,requests

  If your application tries to install a Python extension (ie, a Python
  package that requires compilation), and the extension doesn't have a recipe
  associated to Python-for-android, it will not work. We explicitly disable
  the compilation here. If you want to make it work, contribute to the
  Python-for-android project by creating a recipe. See :doc:`contribute`.

- `presplash.filename`: String, loading screen of your application.

  Presplash is the image shown on the device during application loading.
  It is called presplash on Android, and Loading image on iOS. The image might
  have different requirements depending the platform. Currently, Buildozer
  works well only with Android, iOS support is not great on this.

  The image must be a JPG or PNG, preferable with Power-of-two size, e.g., a
  512x512 image is perfect to target all the devices. The image is not fitted,
  scaled, or anything on the device. If you provide a too-large image, it might
  not fit on small screens.

- `icon.filename`: String, icon of your application.

  The icon of your application. It must be a PNG of 512x512 size to be able to
  cover all the various platform requirements.

- `orientation`: List, supported orientations of the application.

  Indicate the orientations that your application supports.
  Valid values are: `portrait`, `landscape`, `portrait-reverse`, `landscape-reverse`.
  Defaults to `[landscape]`.

- `fullscreen`: Boolean, fullscreen mode.

  Defaults to true, your application will run in fullscreen. Means the status
  bar will be hidden. If you want to let the user access the status bar,
  hour, notifications, use 0 as a value.
