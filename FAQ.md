# FAQ for Buildozer

## Introduction

Buildozer is a development tool for turning  [Python](https://www.python.org/)
applications into binary packages ready for installation on any of a number of
platforms, including mobile devices.

The app developer provides a single "buildozer.spec" file, which describes the
application's requirements and settings, such as title and icons. Buildozer can
then create installable packages for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and/or Linux.

Buildozer is managed by the [Kivy Team](https://kivy.org/about.html). It relies
on its sibling projects: 
[python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/) and 
[Kivy for iOS](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/). It has features to make
building apps using the [Kivy framework](https://github.com/kivy/kivy) easier,
but it can be used independently - even with other GUI frameworks.

## How do I write my own recipes?

Instructions on how to write your own recipes is available in the
[Kivy for iOS](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/) and
[python-for-android documentation](https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/).

Instructions on how to test your own recipes from Buildozer is available in the
