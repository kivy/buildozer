Buildozer
=========

This tool is currently in alpha.

Buildozer is a tool for creating application packages easily.

The goal is to have one "buildozer.spec" file in your app directory, describing
your application requirements and settings such as title, icon, included modules 
etc. Buildozer will use that spec to create a package for Android, iOS, Windows,
OSX and/or Linux. 

Buildozer currently supports packaging for Android via the python-for-android
project, and for iOS via the kivy-ios project. Support for other operating systems
is intended in the future.

Usage example
-------------

#. Install buildozer::

    # latest dev
    git clone git://github.com/kivy/buildozer
    cd buildozer
    sudo python2.7 setup.py install

    # via pip (latest stable)
    sudo pip install buildozer

    # via easy_install
    sudo easy_install buildozer

#. Go into your application directory and do::

    buildozer init
    # edit the buildozer.spec, then
    buildozer android debug deploy run

Example of commands::

    # buildozer commands
    buildozer clean

    # buildozer target command
    buildozer android update
    buildozer android deploy
    buildozer android debug
    buildozer android release

    # or all in one (compile in debug, deploy on device)
    buildozer android debug deploy

    # set the default command if nothing set
    buildozer setdefault android debug deploy run

      debug              Build the application in debug mode
      release            Build the application in release mode

buildozer.spec
--------------

See `buildozer/default.spec <https://raw.github.com/kivy/buildozer/master/buildozer/default.spec>`_ for an up-to-date spec file.


Default config
--------------

You can override the value of *any* buildozer.spec config token by
setting an appropriate environment variable. These are all of the
form ``$SECTION_TOKEN``, where SECTION is the config file section and
TOKEN is the config token to override. Dots are replaced by
underscores.

For example, here are some config tokens from the [app] section of the
config, along with the environment variables that would override them.

- ``title`` -> ``$APP_TITLE``
- ``package.name`` -> ``$APP_PACKAGE_NAME``
- ``android.p4a_dir`` -> ``$APP_ANDROID_P4A_DIR``
