Buildozer
=========

This tool is currently in alpha.

Buildozer is a tool for creating application packages easily.

The goal is to have one "buildozer.spec" file in your app directory: it
describe your application requirements, titles, etc.  Buildozer will use that
spec for create package for Android, iOS, Windows, OSX and Linux.

Usage example
-------------

#. Install buildozer::

    # latest dev
    git clone git://github.com/kivy/buildozer
    cd buildozer
    sudo python2.7 setup.py install

    # via pip (latest stable)
    sudo pip install buildozer

    # via easy_install
    sudo easy_install buildozer

#. Go into your application directory and do::

    buildozer init
    # edit the buildozer.spec, then
    buildozer android debug deploy run

Example of commands::

    # buildozer commands
    buildozer clean

    # buildozer target command
    buildozer android update
    buildozer android deploy
    buildozer android debug
    buildozer android release

    # or all in one (compile in debug, deploy on device)
    buildozer android debug deploy

    # set the default command if nothing set
    buildozer setdefault android debug deploy run
