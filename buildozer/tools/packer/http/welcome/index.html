<h1>Welcome to the Kivy/Buildozer VM</h1>
<p id="menu">
    <a href="https://github.com/kivy/buildozer">Github</a> -
    <a href="https://buildozer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Documentation</a>
</p>

<p>
    Thanks for using Kivy/Buildozer VM. It has been installed only for
    packaging Kivy application for Android.<br/>
    <b>Credentials</b>: username: <code>kivy</code> / password: <code>kivy</code>
</p>

<h2>How to use the VM</h2>
<p>
    Buildozer is ready to be used. You'll need internet connection for
    download the Android SDK/NDK (automatically done), and during the first
    compilation.
    <br/>
    It is preferrable to add a <a href="#sharefolder">share a folder
    </a> between your host and the VM, then build from there.<br/>

    By the time we shipped the VM and you using it, you may need to
    <a href="#update-buildozer">update buildozer</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Don't try to use latest Android SDK or NDK</b>. The defaults from buildozer
    works: Android SDK 20, Android NDK 9c. Recent Android SDK doesn't work
    the same as before (no more android command), and python-for-android
    project have issues with it. As for NDK, you can use 13b, it works too.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>First time only, in your project directory: <code>buildozer init</code></li>
    <li>Adjust the <code>buildozer.spec</code>:
        <pre>[buildozer]
# change the name of your app
package.name = myapp

# change the domain of your package
package.domain = com.mydomain

# specify hostpython2 manually. If you want to use python 3, check buildozer
# README about it, the VM is not preinstalled for that.
requirements = hostpython2,kivy

[buildozer]
# update the build directory (issue with virtualbox shared folder and symlink)
build_dir = /build/myapp
</pre></li>
    <li>Build your application: <code>buildozer android_new debug</code></li>
    <li>Build and deploy, run and get the logs: <code>buildozer android_new debug deploy run logcat</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sharefolder">Share a folder</h2>
<p>
    Virtualbox allows you to share a folder between your computer and the
    VM. To do, just:
    <ol>
        <li>Go into Devices &gt; Shared Folders &gt; Shared Folders Settings</li>
        <li>Add a new folder, select the automount option</li>
        <li>Reboot the VM (that's easier)</li>
        <li>You'll find your new directory at <code>/media/sf_directoryname</code></li>
    </ol>
</p>

<div class="warning">
    Virtualbox doesn't support symlink in Shared Folder anymore. So buildozer
    will fail during the build.<br/>
    We already created a <code>/build</code> directory where you can put your
    build in it. Edit your <code>buildozer.ini</code>:
    <pre>[buildozer]
build_dir = /build/buildozer-myapp</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="update-buildozer">Update buildozer</h2>
<p>
    The buildozer version you have may be outdated, as well as the dependencies.
    The best is to regulary update buildozer:
    <pre>sudo pip install -U buildozer</pre>
</p>

<h2>Cleaning cache</h2>

<p>
    The simplest way to update kivy and other modules is to clean all the
    buildozer cache, and rebuild everything.

    <pre>rm -rf ~/.buildozer/android/packages</pre>
<p>
